## How to Read and Clear Fault Codes with VCDS 12.12.3
 
One of the most useful features of VCDS 12.12.3 is the ability to read and clear fault codes from various control modules in your car. Fault codes are stored when the car detects a problem with a sensor, actuator, or system. Reading fault codes can help you diagnose the cause of a problem, and clearing fault codes can reset the service indicators or warning lights on your dashboard.
 
To read and clear fault codes with VCDS 12.12.3, follow these steps:

1. Connect your interface to your car's diagnostic port and launch VCDS 12.12.3.
2. Select Auto Scan from the main menu and wait for the scan to complete.
3. You will see a list of control modules with their status and number of fault codes (if any).
4. Select a control module that has fault codes by clicking on it.
5. You will see a detailed report of the fault codes, including their description, frequency, and status.
6. To clear the fault codes, click on Clear Codes at the bottom of the screen.
7. You will be asked to confirm your action. Click Yes to proceed.
8. The fault codes will be cleared and you will see a confirmation message.
9. Click Done, Go Back to return to the Auto Scan screen.
10. Repeat steps 4 to 9 for any other control modules that have fault codes.

## How to Code and Recode Control Modules with VCDS 12.12.3
 
Another useful feature of VCDS 12.12.3 is the ability to code and recode control modules in your car. Coding is the process of changing the settings or configuration of a control module, such as enabling or disabling certain features or functions. Recoding is the process of changing the software version or variant of a control module, such as updating it to a newer version or changing it to a different region or market.
 
To code and recode control modules with VCDS 12.12.3, follow these steps:

1. Connect your interface to your car's diagnostic port and launch VCDS 12.12.3.
2. Select Select Control Module from the main menu and choose a control module that you want to code or recode.
3. You will see a screen with various options for that control module.
4. To code the control module, click on Coding - 07.
5. You will see a screen with the current coding value and a list of possible options for each byte and bit.
6. To change an option, click on it and select a new value from the drop-down menu.
7. To save your changes, click on Do It! at the bottom of the screen.
8. You will be asked to confirm your action. Click Yes to proceed.
9. The coding value will be changed and you will see a confirmation message.
10. Click Done, Go Back to return to the previous screen.
11. To recode the control module, click on Software Coding - 22.
12. You will see a screen with the current software coding value and a list of possible options for each digit.
13. To change an option, click on it and select a new value from the drop-down menu.
14. To save your changes, click on Do It! at the bottom of the screen.
15. You will be asked to confirm your action. Click Yes to proceed.
