## Step 1: Contact Your Carrier
 
The first thing you need to do is contact your current carrier and ask them to unlock your iPhone 5. You may need to provide some information, such as your account details, your phone number, your IMEI number, and the reason why you want to unlock your phone. You can find your IMEI number by going to Settings > General > About on your iPhone 5.
 
After you submit the request, it may take a few days for your carrier to process it and confirm that they have unlocked your iPhone. You can check the status of your request by contacting your carrier again or by following the instructions they give you.
 
## Step 2: Remove Your Old SIM Card and Insert the New One
 
Once your carrier has confirmed that they have unlocked your iPhone 5, you need to remove your old SIM card and insert the new one from the different carrier. To do this, you need a SIM eject tool or a paper clip. Follow these steps:
