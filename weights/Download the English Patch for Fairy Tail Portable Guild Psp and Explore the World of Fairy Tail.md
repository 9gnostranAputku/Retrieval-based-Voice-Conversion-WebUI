If you are a fan of the popular anime and manga series Fairy Tail, you might be interested in playing the video game adaptation for the PlayStation Portable (PSP) called Fairy Tail Portable Guild. This game was released by Konami in Japan in 2010, but it never got an official English localization. However, thanks to some dedicated fans, there is an unofficial English patch that you can download and apply to the game to enjoy it in your language.
  
In this article, we will show you how to download and play the English patched version of Fairy Tail Portable Guild PSP. You will need a PSP console or a PSP emulator on your PC or mobile device, as well as a copy of the original Japanese game ISO file. You will also need to download the English patch file from this link[^1^]. This patch translates all of the text to English, but it does not change the voice acting or the opening and ending songs.

Once you have downloaded the patch file, you will need to extract it using a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip. You will get a folder called "Fairy Tail Portable Guild English Patch" that contains two files: "FTPG\_English\_Patch.xdelta" and "xdelta UI.exe". You will need to use these files to apply the patch to the game ISO file.
  
To do this, follow these steps:
  
1. Open the "xdelta UI.exe" file and click on "Open" next to "Patch".
2. Select the "FTPG\_English\_Patch.xdelta" file and click on "Open".
3. Click on "Open" next to "Source File".
4. Select the original Japanese game ISO file and click on "Open".
5. Click on "Save As" next to "Output File".
6. Choose a name and location for the patched game ISO file and click on "Save".
7. Click on "Patch" and wait for the process to finish.

Congratulations! You have successfully patched the game with English subtitles. Now you can transfer the patched game ISO file to your PSP memory stick or load it on your PSP emulator. You can enjoy playing Fairy Tail Portable Guild PSP with your favorite characters and guilds from the anime and manga series.
  
Fairy Tail Portable Guild PSP is a role-playing game that lets you create your own character and join one of the four major guilds: Fairy Tail, Lamia Scale, Blue Pegasus, or Cait Shelter. You can also recruit other characters from the series as your teammates and fulfill various guild requests. The game features an original story that takes place after the Tower of Heaven arc and before the OraciÃƒÂ³n Seis arc. You can also unlock different costumes, items, and skills for your character as you progress through the game.
  
If you are looking for more Fairy Tail games for PSP, you can also check out Fairy Tail Portable Guild 2, which is a sequel that was released in 2011. It has more characters, guilds, quests, and features than the first game. However, there is no English patch available for this game yet, so you will have to play it in Japanese or wait for someone to translate it.
