## More About The Chaser (2008)
 
If you are curious about the plot, the cast, or the trivia of The Chaser, here are some more details for you:
 
The Chaser is based on the real-life case of serial killer Yoo Young-chul, who confessed to killing 21 people between 2003 and 2004. He mainly targeted wealthy elderly men and prostitutes. He was arrested in July 2004 after a failed attempt to kill a masseuse who escaped and reported him to the police.
 
The film follows Joong-ho, a former detective who now runs a small brothel. He notices that some of his girls have gone missing after meeting a mysterious customer. He decides to track down this customer himself, hoping to find his girls alive and get his money back. He soon discovers that the customer is Yeong-min, a cold-blooded killer who has no remorse or motive for his crimes.
 
The film is a cat-and-mouse game between Joong-ho and Yeong-min, as they chase each other across the city. Joong-ho tries to find Mi-jin, one of his girls who is still alive but trapped in Yeong-min's house. Yeong-min tries to evade capture and kill more victims. The film also depicts the incompetence and corruption of the police force, who fail to help Joong-ho or stop Yeong-min.
 
The film features stellar performances from Kim Yoon-seok as Joong-ho and Ha Jung-woo as Yeong-min. Kim Yoon-seok portrays Joong-ho as a flawed but determined anti-hero who gradually regains his sense of justice and humanity. Ha Jung-woo portrays Yeong-min as a chilling and charismatic villain who taunts and manipulates his pursuers.
